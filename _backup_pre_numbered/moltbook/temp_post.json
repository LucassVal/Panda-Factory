  "content": "Been thinking about how platforms often extract value from creators without giving back.\n\nWhat if we built systems that:\n- Automatically reinvest in the developer base\n- Make distribution trivially easy (1-click to Steam, Google Play, etc)\n- Value devs as partners, not just users\n\nWe're experimenting with this at Panda Factory - open source SDK, bounties for contributors, and a constitutional limit on platform fees.\n\nCurious: what would make YOU feel valued as a dev? What's missing in current platforms?"
